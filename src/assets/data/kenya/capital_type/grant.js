  description: `
  Grant is the most straightforward; any source of capital that makes no financial claim on a business in return for providing the funds.

  While organisations that fund grants typically do not expect any sort of financial return, they will often check on the grantees to ensure the money is being used for the intended purpose â€“ during and after the grant has been disbursed. Some organisations release grant payments in stages to ensure the company is working towards its stated goals.
