  <ol>
    <li><b>Do your research</b> – you need to screen potential members of your board. Look out for what other businesses they are involved in, and whether there may be potential conflicts of interest; ask those businesses about how engaged the person is.</li>
    <li><b>Find advisors in your market</b> – board members are will tire of traveling long distances to attend meetings. So, make sure the board is made up of people who are near your target market, and who will be able to allocate reasonable amounts of time to your start-up</li>
    <li><b>Focus on the value-add</b> – as one investor put it, board members should add value in one of two ways: deep industry experience in your sector, or deep functional experience in an area crucial to your business (e.g., sales, finance, or operations).</li>
    <li><b>Take advice seriously</b> – being humble and taking feedback and constructive criticism is key to keeping the board on your side. It is also a quality of successful entrepreneurs. One board member said that one of his key responsibilities is to question everything the founder thinks and does — as his or her employees may not feel comfortable questioning their boss.</li>
