  description:
    'Time after time, we heard from both investors and entrepreneurs that being able to tell their story is key to raising money successfully. Here are a few tips:',
  list: `
  <ol>
    <li><b>Introduction:</b> Many investors will put money in you as the entrepreneur, more so than your company, so make sure you are clear in why you have started your company and what you hope to achieve.</li>
    <li><b>Market:</b> Who are you selling to, and what problem is it solving? If you have a track record of sales, great; if not, be ready to answer questions about why someone will pay you to solve a perceived problem.</li>
    <li><b>Future growth:</b> If you have not sold a product yet, make informed assumptions about how many you will sell in the coming months, the cost of production, and how many units you need to sell before you break-even.</li>
    <li><b>Investment ask:</b> Do your research and explain how the funding will get you to the next key milestone. This should not be an investment in people or machinery, but the outcome of that investment.</li>
    <li><b>Finish:</b> Showcase how your company is aligned with the investor you are pitching to.</li>
