  <ol>
    <li><b>Personal introductions are best.</b> Do your research and find out how you may be able to get introduced to an investor. Because the start-up scene is still emerging in Kenya, there are likely only a few degrees of separation between you and the investor.</li>
    <li><b>Seek out portfolio companies.</b> Find out who the investor has already backed and reach out to those start-ups. Most will be happy to share their experiences, and put you in touch if your idea is well-developed.</li>
    <li><b>Enter accelerator/incubator/mentoring programmes.</b> Connecting to investors is one of the key reasons start-ups apply to these programmes, and they can be good for facilitating introductions.</li>
    <li><b>Networking events take place around Nairobi.</b> These can be invite-only (in which case you can reach out to the organiser), or open to the public. Even if you do not find your investor there, the people you meet can bring you one step closer.</li>
    <li><b>Cold outreaches are a last resort.</b> If you did your research and cannot find a connection, send a brief but informative email with your pitch deck attached. Emphasise your track record in your email (products sold, users signed up, etc.).</li>
