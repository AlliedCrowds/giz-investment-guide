  title: 'Pitching Effectively',
  description:
    'Every entrepreneur has a different pitching style, and the start-up’s business model / maturity will affect what exactly the pitch looks like. But, there are similarities around what investors will want entrepreneurs to cover:',
  list: `
  <ol>
    <li><b>Traction so far:</b> Investors want to see what your start-up has achieved. 'Has anyone parted with their money for your product or service?' is how one investor put it.</li>
    <li><b>What makes your team special?</b> If an investor is not sold on your team, they will not invest in your business no matter how much potential the idea has.</li>
    <li><b>Know your market well:</b> Has anyone else tried to solve this problem? How is your solution different? You need to back up your assertions with hard data.</li>
    <li><b>Your track record:</b> If it's your first startup, you should be able to talk about what you have done since you graduated from school — what companies have you worked for, what problems have you tried to solve? Keep up with old contacts who may be asked to vouch for you.</li>
    <li><b>Your thinking process is important:</b> You should ground your projections in reality, but the most important thing about the numbers is being able to clearly talk through them, and to explain your hypotheses.</li>
  </ol>
