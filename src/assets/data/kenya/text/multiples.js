  description: `
  The multiples approach compares similar start-ups to obtain the valuation. This would mean if one start-up – similar to yours in terms of sector, size, business model, etc. – with sales of KSh 2m ($20k) is valued at KSh 10m ($100k) it implies a value to sales multiple of 5 (KSh 10m/KSh 2m, or in dollar terms $100k/$20k). If the start-up is truly similar to yours, you can use this multiple to value your start-up. Assuming your start-up had sales of KSh 4m ($40k) its valuation would therefore be KSh 4m x 5 = KSh 20m (or $40k x 5 = $200k in dollar terms). \n\n <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp" target="_blank">Learn more about Multiples Models</a>
