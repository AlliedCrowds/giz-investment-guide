  title: 'A Good Timing',
  description: `
  One of the most important decisions you need to make is when to actually begin approaching investors. Nearly every start-up should be bootstrapped for as long as possible. If you can get your company to profitability without raising money from outside investors, you should.

The decision on when to fundraise also depends on the founders’ connections and experience in the start-up industry. If you have exited several companies in the past and have connections to investors, then the timing of the fundraising process will be different than for someone who is a first-time founder.

Most, however, are not experienced entrepreneurs, and do not have the ability to bootstrap the company indefinitely. The good news is you can raise money fairly early on in a start-up’s journey. As long as you have a strong idea, and do some work around putting together a pitch deck that explains how this idea will become a viable business, you may be able to approach (relatively small) investors.
