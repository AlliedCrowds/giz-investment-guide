  title: 'Putting Together a Board of Directors',
  description: `
  As is stated throughout this guide, networking is crucial for businesses in Kenya. One reason is that it can help you to find people who you can put on your board of directors. The board is responsible for the overall direction of the company and will help you make important decisions, so it is key to get people who are engaged and have a good track record.

  As the founder(s), you will be on the board, along with (most likely) your investors. After this, you will be able to invite several other individuals to sit on the board â€” try to make this an odd number so there are no ties during voting. For earlier stage businesses that have not received funding, a board of advisors could also play the role of the board. It pushes the founder to be accountable to external parties while giving much needed advice and guidance.

  The process of getting a board of advisors is similar to the one of getting a formal board. The next page contains some tips on putting together a board.
