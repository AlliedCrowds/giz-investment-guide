  title: 'Valuing Your Start-up',
  description: `
  Imagine two fictitious entrepreneurs have an idea for an e-commerce company and decide to set up a company around it: Widgets Ltd. They decide that it is fair to split up ownership of the company in half. They issue 1,000 company shares, and take 500 shares each, meaning each one owns 50% of the company.

  After spending some time to work on their idea, they approach several angel investors, one of whom is interested. He decides to invest $10,000 in the company. In exchange, he gets 100 shares that the founders issue to the angel. So, he owns 100/1100 shares (9.1%), while the founders now own 500/1100 (45%) each. Because the angel’s $10,000 investment bought him 9% of the company, the post-money valuation is $110,000. At this point, the price per share is $100 (= $110,000/1100).

  After some months, Widgets attracts media attention and customers; several VCs become interested in investing in the company. The start-up’s founders decide to raise $100,000. They turn to an early-stage VC, who agrees to invest the money in exchange for 500 shares. That gets the VC 500/1600 shares (31.25%), and values the company at $320,000. The price per share after this investment rises to $200 (= $320,000/1600). That means if the angel investor wanted to cash out, he would have made 100% return in just a few months.
