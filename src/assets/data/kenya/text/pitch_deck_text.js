  description: `
  For both the one pager and the pitch deck, a small amount of customisation/tweaking to better fit the investor can go a long way. For example, if the investor is known for wanting to see how the investment may effect social or environmental change, add a slide (or at least a few bullet points) about how your start-up may do that.

  Remember that as soon as you raise money, expectations will shift. It is no longer just your money and time. Investors will expect increased reporting and tracking, as well as formalized recordkeeping and the like. Do not be unreasonable, and do not make empty promises, but do come across as optimistic, hopeful, hungry, and ready for the increased scrutiny of the business.
