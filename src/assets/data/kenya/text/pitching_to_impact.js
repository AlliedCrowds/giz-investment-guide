  title: 'Pitching to Impact Investors',
  description: `
  Impact investors vary widely in their emphasis on social and environmental impact. Some will screen out investments that have potential to make a negative impact, but will not specifically look to invest in companies that have a stated aim to make a positive impact.

  Others have a much more specific view on what counts as impact, and will ask entrepreneurs to report the impact metrics they agree upon.

  The first task will be to choose which metrics to track. If your company is involved in renewable energy, for example, tracking the number of households affected and the amount of CO2 emissions foregone makes sense.

  After that, put together a theory of change that explains: what challenges youâ€™re addressing, what operations you will conduct, what direct outputs your company will create, what will be the outcomes of those outputs, and how these will contribute to a higher impact objective that addresses the identified challenges.
