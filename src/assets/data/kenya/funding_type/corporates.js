  description: `
  Large firms often support entrepreneurs, projects, and SMEs financially. There are various motivations for corporates to fund businesses. One is to ensure they stay up to date on what innovative start-ups are doing in relevant sectors, and get an opportunity to invest in those companies early on. Another is a way to spend corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding.

  When companies are funding companies and projects via their CSR initiatives, they will often act like impact investors, asking not only for a business plan, but also a way to monitor how the money is being used. While corporates can be a great partner for your start-up, do make sure you protect your intellectual property (IP) before opening up any business secrets.
