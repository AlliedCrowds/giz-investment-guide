  Banks are licensed financial institutions that are able to make loans and take deposits, among other services. In emerging markets, commercial banks tend to shy away from the SME sector, seeing it as risky and costly; they tend to work with large firms. The same applies to Kenya.

  Banks that work with SMEs offer various financial products, including asset financing and invoice factoring. Like other funders, they want to see a comprehensive breakdown of how the funding will be used, several yearsâ€™ financial history, and collateral. Make sure you calculate how much you will need to pay every month and consider carefully whether that is something your company can afford.
