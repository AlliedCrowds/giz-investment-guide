  description: `
  Foundations are non-profit charitable organisations that are founded with an initial endowment, typically made by an individual or business. The foundations tend to have a specific goal or sector of interest, and they fund other charities, NGOs, projects, and companies that work toward that goal.

  The amount of funding they make available varies based on the foundation’s endowment. Large foundations can fund millions of dollars’ worth of projects, though the vast majority are smaller. Foundations will typically look for how closely a company’s mission and activities match with the desired outcomes the foundation wants to achieve. It is important to ensure your impact aligns with the foundation's.
