  description: `
  An angel investor network is a group made up of individuals who inject capital into an angel network fund in order to provide funding for start-ups in exchange for equity. The network is made up of experienced professionals, who have knowledge and contacts in the industry in which they invest.

  Angels invest in companies with high growth potential, and tend to look at a wide range of sectors. Angels typically step in to provide funding for companies that have exhausted any friend and family investments or personal savings they may have been able to access, and prior to investment from VCs.
