  These new types of funders use either data stored on customers’ phones, or online forms to determine their creditworthiness. That makes it easier to determine prospective borrowers’ potential default rate, maximum loan size, and loan maturity.

  While some of these funders may be able to fund larger amounts, the majority focus on relatively small funding amounts at first, and increasing the maximum loan size as borrowers establish a more solid track record. As they work with more borrowers and get better data on borrowers, they will be able to fund larger amounts. In the meantime, however, they can be a convenient (but expensive) source of working capital during periods of tight cash flows.
