  description: `
  Impact investor refers to funds that invest with the intention to create a positive, measurable social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. The expected range of return for these investments is often below market rate or return is measured by a different metric, e.g., social change or impact measurement.

  As social and environmental impact is key for these funders, it is important to show not only how your company will work toward achieving these aims, but also how you will measure and prove the impact you want to achieve. Nigeria’s impact investment scene is only just emerging, with most investors holding the view that investing in Nigeria’s companies (as long as they do not actively damage the environment or cause social ills) will likely result in a positive impact.
