  description: `
  Crowdfunding is the practice of raising money from a large group of individuals, typically through an online portal. There are four prevalent models of crowdfunding: donation-based, reward-based, lending-based, equity-based.

  Depending on the type of crowdfunding campaign an entrepreneur chooses, they will need to prepare different types of pitches. For lending- and equity-based campaigns, investors will want to see a strong business plan, financial projections, and a growth strategy. For reward-based campaigns, backers will want to see an innovative product or project in a sleek campaign video. For donation-based campaigns, backers will want to see how their donation will benefit the recipient(s).
