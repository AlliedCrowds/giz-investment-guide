  title: 'Public / Semi-Public Funders',
  description: `
  Public/semi-public capital refers to funding providers where part or all of their funding is received from government sources. This is a broad group that includes a wide range of capital providers. These include fully or partially publicly funded organisations that work in various sectors to promote access to capital. These may include annual government-funded start-up and/or innovation competitions, multilateral aid organisations, development finance institutions (DFIs), etc.

  Because they are backed by the government, they enjoy trust among entrepreneurs and project owners, and can be the first port of call when they look for capital.
