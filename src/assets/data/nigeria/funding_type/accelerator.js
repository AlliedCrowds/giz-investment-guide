  title: 'Accelerators and Incubators',
  description: `
  These companies work with early stage start-ups to help nurture them at a crucial stage in their lifecycle. They provide start-ups with a great environment to grow their business. Typically, accelerators and incubators are focused on technology start-ups.

  There are some differences between incubators and accelerators. Generally, incubators are less structured and are more focused on providing a physical co-working area and access to their networks for very early stage start-ups; some fund the start-ups in the incubation programme, but many do not. Accelerators are aimed at those start-ups advanced enough to be ready to grow and scale their business. An accelerator generally takes equity in the business in exchange for access to the programme, the facilities, and their mentor network.
