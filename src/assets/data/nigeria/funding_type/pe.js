  description: `
  Private equity (PE) firms invest directly in private companies. They tend to focus on companies that are more mature than those in VCs’ remit. PE firms are often structured as a limited partnership, with institutional investors and/or HNWIs providing funds for partners to manage. As PE firms invest in more mature companies, they tend to invest much larger amounts than VCs — ₦1.8b ($5m) and above. That makes them an imperfect fit for smaller firms.

  In Nigeria, PE investors typically participate in deals via acquisitions of minority stakes, management buyouts, and restructurings. As PE funds tend to make large equity investments, they typically get fairly hands-on in the management of the companies. They usually focus on larger, more established companies that they feel can improve operations and become more profitable.
