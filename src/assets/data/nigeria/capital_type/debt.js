  description: `
  Debt financing means an entrepreneur takes out a loan from a financial institution, which they promise to repay within a predetermined time period, and subject to an agreed interest rate. Debt funding can come from various types of funders, including banks, crowdfunding, impact investors, development finance institutions, and microfinance institutions.

  As start-ups need to pay interest on their loans, debt financing is best suited to more mature start-ups with stable cash flows. Borrowers typically focus on two key aspects of the financing structure: the interest rate and the maturity. The less likely the borrower is to pay back, the higher the interest rate a lender is going to charge.
