  title: 'Mezzanine',
  description: `
  Mezzanine is a hybrid instrument and refers to financing that sits between equity and debt, and combines aspects of both types. It is popular with some investors because it shields them from some risk of a pure equity investment, while still providing upside if a business becomes highly successful.

  There are various types of mezzanine financing, including subordinated debt, convertible notes, and equity kickers. The degree to which an investor is willing to be exposed to risk will dictate the amount of equity upside versus debt for which they will negotiate. While convertible notes can be difficult to understand, the key thing to keep in mind is that the amount an investor puts in as debt will be converted to equity at a later point, to be defined in the contract.`,
