  description: `
Equity financing means an investor puts money into a start-up, in exchange for a portion of the company’s shares. This means the investor becomes a part owner of the business.

Equity investment varies in amount, depending on the entrepreneur’s needs. It includes everything from relatively small (less than ₦18m or $50k) injections of capital from family members or angel investors, to large deals financed by private equity firms that run into millions of dollars. Equity is the riskiest type of financing for investors, as the funders stand to lose their entire investment should a company fail.
