  title: 'Net Assets Model',
  description: `
  The net assets valuation approach calculates the total value of the tangible assets it has. For start-ups, this would usually result in the lowest valuation, since most start-ups do not own a lot of assets â€” it is the intangible assets like the idea, the potential, and team talent that excites investors.

  It is important for each entrepreneur to note that the final price in a deal is a combination of the valuation and negotiation between the investor and entrepreneur.
