  Across the continent, fintech is a popular sector with investors. This is also true in Nigeria, with companies like Riby and Paystack attracting significant investor interest.

  <b>Targeting Consumers:</b> Many Nigerian start-ups find it difficult to crack the B2C market, where the costs of acquiring a new user is high and the typical user’s spending power low.

  Start-ups’ lack of desire to target consumers is also because the potential market size is not as large as the headline numbers suggest. One entrepreneur, for instance, pointed out that telecoms sell data bundles that restrict data usage to specific apps, like WhatsApp or Facebook.

  <b>Targeting Businesses:</b> For these reasons, many of the start-ups in Nigeria target businesses, who have more cash to pay for the start-ups’ products and services. If your solution is a truly B2C one, potential investors will likely ask a lot of questions around how you plan to make money in a market where so many others have not had success. One investor in Nigerian start-ups said it is important for start-ups to think carefully through their customer acquisition and growth strategy.
