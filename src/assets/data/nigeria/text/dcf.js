  title: 'DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) Model',
  description:
    'The DCF methodology computes the cash flows the start-up expects to make in future and discounts this to the present. Discounting is the process in which future cash flows/payments are adjusted for inflation and risk in order to find out their present value. The discount rate is a highly debated variable, and it will be set by the funder when evaluating the investment. It is a good idea to create several scenarios with different discount rates and therefore different net present values; make sure you can explain the reasoning behind the different scenarios.',
