  description: `
  The multiples approach compares similar start-ups to obtain the valuation. This would mean if one start-up — similar to yours in terms of sector, size, business model, etc. — with sales of ₦7.2m ($20k) is valued at ₦36m ($100k) it implies a value to sales multiple of five (N36m/N7.2m, or in dollar terms $100k/$20k). If the start-up is truly similar to yours, you can use this multiple to value your start-up. Assuming your start-up had sales of ₦14.4m ($40k) its valuation would therefore be ₦14.4m x 5 = ₦72m (or $40k x 5 = $200k in dollar terms).
