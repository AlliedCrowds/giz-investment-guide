  title: 'Start-ups, Your Valuation Matters!',
  description: `
  Valuation and why it matters is important for every start-up up to understand. This is because it affects not only the companyâ€™s short-term prospects, but can also have important ramifications down the line.

  Of course, one of the key questions is how does the investor obtain a certain valuation and, hence, the shareholding he or she accepts in the business. Many factors come into play to determine this, key among them being the cash flows a company expects to make, current performance, and even the number of investors interested in the deal.

  There are various methodologies used to come up with a company valuation. The key ones include: discounted cash flow (DCF), multiples based, and assets-based methodologies.
