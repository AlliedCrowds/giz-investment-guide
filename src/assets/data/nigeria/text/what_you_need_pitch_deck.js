  title: 'Brief One-Pager',
  description: `
  Generally, investors will want to see a comprehensive one pager that outlines a business idea and how the company plans to build a compelling product around this idea. 

  This should be a mini-business plan, and should include a succinct overview of what the business is, what problem it is solving, and how you plan to turn your idea into an appealing product. Include charts, images (including your company logo), and graphs as much as possible; but, do not forget to clearly articulate, in writing, the purpose of your business and how you plan to execute it. This is a document you could leave behind so make sure to balance substance with visual appeal.
