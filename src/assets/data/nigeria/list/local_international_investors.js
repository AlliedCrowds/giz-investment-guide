  title: 'Local vs. International Investors',
  description:
    'As the start-up scene continues to flourish in Nigeria, it is attracting growing interest from both local and international investors. There are differences between what local and international funders offer to start-ups. Here are a few things we heard:',
  list: `
  <ol>
    <li><b>International investors are more founder-friendly.</b> They typically take a smaller equity share and are more comfortable investing in the potential of the idea. They may also be more comfortable with waiting longer for an exit opportunity.</li>
    <li><b>Local investors know the market players.</b> This is quite obvious, but something that entrepreneurs can forget. If you are creating a product exclusively for the Nigerian market, most international investors will be unable to help much with connections or industry expertise.</li>
    <li><b>International investors may not understand the country context.</b> When pitching to them, you will also need to explain the market structure and how your idea can be developed into a profitable product. One start-up, for instance, noted that following the naira depreciation over the last several years, start ups reporting their revenues in dollars had to explain why their businesses were not doing well, even if, in naira terms, they were still growing.</li>
