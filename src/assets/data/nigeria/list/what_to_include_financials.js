  title: 'What to Include in Your Financials',
  description:
    'Most investors in early-stage companies will understand that start-ups’ financial models are educated guesses, at best. Your financials should be more of a way for investors to judge your ability to plan ahead, conduct research, and come up with a compelling pitch. Here are the things you should include as your financials:',
  list: `
  <ul>
    <li><b>Key assumptions:</b> What is the cost of acquiring a customer? The product price? Increase of goods sold per month or year? Customer retention rate? Projected employee costs? Think through your business, create a list of key assumptions, and be able to walk the investors through. To take it one step further, create a base case of assumptions; a downside case, in which business is slower than you expect; and a home run case, where business is better than you expect.</li>
    <li><b>Cash flow statement, balance sheet, and income statement:</b> The three documents are linked to one another, so you should think of them as a package. They are meant to provide a snapshot of your business, as well as create a basis for future projections.</li>
    <li><b>Use of funds:</b> Investors will want to understand how, specifically, you plan to use their capital to grow their business. Be intentional here – specify how you plan to use the money, and how it will get you to break-even, or to the next fundraise.</li>
  </ul>
