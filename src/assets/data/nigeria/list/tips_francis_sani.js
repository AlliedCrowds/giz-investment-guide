  <ol>
    <li><b>Create something unique.</b> Some start-ups come up with new features to add to existing solutions, but do not actually build something that is truly new. Investors will know the difference between a genuine innovation and a product with new features.</li>
    <li><b>Have a good understanding of your market.</b> Founders should truly understand the market situation; importantly, they should know how to make money from solving problems in the market. Some start-ups have false assumptions and struggle to gain traction.</li>
    <li><b>Show commitment to solving a problem.</b> Some of the most successful entrepreneurs have a proven track record of working on solving a problem. Investors like to see someone who is committed to solving a problem.</li>
    <li><b>Do not make assumptions about your product.</b> Be ready to accept user feedback and pivot if your early adopters are using your product in ways you did not expect. Do not force a solution that they do not want.</li>
    <li><b>Do your homework on partners and investors.</b> What do they bring to the table? Look for people who will truly add value to your business.</li>
    <li><b>Understand both online and offline aspects of your business.</b> In Nigeria, even tech start ups need to conduct at least some of their business offline. Just because you build a platform or website for your business, it does not mean clients will feel comfortable transacting there â€” think about how to approach offline transactions before you build your site.</li>
