    'Fundraising is a crucial part of many start-ups’ journeys. The steps will vary depending on the start-up’s sector, location, etc.; but in general, the process leading up to getting investors looks like this:',
  list: `
  <ol>
    <li><b>Generate a great idea:</b> the entrepreneur should identify what pain point exists for businesses or consumers, identify a solution, and think about how to turn that solution into a product or service. </li>
    <li><b>Begin networking:</b> next begin networking and meeting as many potential partners and investors as you can in your market. The earlier you make connections, the better. </li>
    <li><b>Build your team:</b> it is important to build the right team around the founder to develop the idea and the product. Choose someone who you know and trust as your co-founder, and try to find someone that complements your own skillset well.</li>
    <li><b>Create an early version of your product:</b> not every great idea turns into a great product. Creating something for potential customers to try out early on is important to ensure you are listening to their needs, and can pivot if needed.</li>
    <li><b>Consider an accelerator / incubator program:</b> different accelerators and incubators will demand various criteria in the start-ups they accept into their programmes. Generally,  they provide access to networks and mentorship (and sometimes funding).</li>
    <li><b>Gain traction:</b> investors want to see a product or service being used. This can mean number of customers, page views, etc. If you cannot prove your product or service is being embraced by the market in some way, investors are unlikely to look very hard at your business.</li>
    <li><b>Do your homework:</b> ensure that you are ready for the upcoming process. This means agreeing on how much money to raise, preparing a good pitch deck, agreeing internally on the terms of the raise, and, most importantly, putting the key documentation for a fundraiser in order. </li>
    <li><b>Raise funding for scaling:</b> once the solution has been figured out – your solution addresses a problem well and money for scaling is the only challenge – it is time to raise money from investors.</li>
